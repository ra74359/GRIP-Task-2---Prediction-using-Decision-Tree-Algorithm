# GRIP-Task-2---Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm
In this section implementation of decision tree classifier and visualize it graphically for the given iris dataset. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.  import numpy as np
